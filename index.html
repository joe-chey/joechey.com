				With recent bachelor's degrees from Computer Science and Music from the University of Virginia (2018), I use Java, HTML/CSS, and Javascript to build and maintain enterprise web applications facing more than 40,000 users. Shaped by my entrepreneurship experience of working with more than 100 cross-functional volunteer student designers, musicians, and strategists, I believe that the interdependent presence of functionality and design is vital to the success of any product. On top of writing reusable and well-documented code, I place importance in designing beautiful user experience that help establish meaningful connection between the user and the product.

				This is where I learned what it means to lead without authority, build mission-driven teams, and balance short-term and long-term strategic goals. Committed to creating polished instrumental music productions for the millennials, I worked with top student talents in music, design, marketing, and strategy to continuously refine priorities and strategies based on user interviews.

				From the beginning to the end of my leadership term, Kinetic Sound faced the same difficulties as all other student organizations on campus: its members being volunteers with primary objectives as full-time University students. By being able to recognize and address this fundamental challenge, I was able to lead the group into a successful launch of its first live classical music concert production designed for college students, attracting <a class="contentLink" href="https://youtu.be/F0fl-afxh8M" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">over 140</a> students in Fall 2015, just three months after the founding of Kinetic Sound. From there, we continued to focus on user feedback - both internal and external - and hit the record number of student audience in 2017, making it the largest student audience for any instrumental music concert production at UVA in the recent years.

				The unexpected success with attracting college students to classical music concerts can be attributed to one key strategy that tied together the different components and talents within the organization. In using social media as the major distribution channel for visual arts products created in collaboration with the musicians, my vision was to not only bridge the conceptual gap between the audience and the less popular genre of classical music, but more importantly to deeply penetrate the social network of the student artists involved in the organization. This allowed Kinetic Sound to give a sense of ownership, community, and brand even to those not in the organization.

				While the number of active members was a strong indicator of performance and brand for many organizations on campus, there were some core values within members that I valued far more importantly than simply getting them to join: a demonstrated passion for creativity, a dedicated curiosity about the world and/or themselves, and personal integrity. I worked tirelessly to align the organization's objectives and interests with these members' values, and it was through these values that Kinetic Sound continued to attract top student talents at the University, cultivating its mission-focused culture that drove the growth of the organization.

				In my final year of college, I wanted to rebrand the University's 200-year-old school song to reflect the complex layers of social and individual developments experienced by the University community. In addition to creating and managing the product roadmap from beginning to completion, I worked closely with a designer throughout the process and pitched the idea on numerous occasions, including a selective <a class="contentLink" href = "https://newcityarts.org/vocation/charlottesville-soup" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">crowdfunding event</a> to secure and manage $4,000 in multiple institutional sponsorships.

				After determining that the University community was interested in authentic Japanese cultural experience, I reached out to a calligraphy master in Charlottesville, visiting from Japan. Following weeks of written and in-person negotiation with the calligrapher, local residents, and the event staff, I successfully curated and collaborated in a series of dynamic calligraphy performances open to public at no charge, where the calligrapher dynamically produced calligraphy pieces with the lyrics of a live song that inspired her real-time.
