			<p class="description">
				With the mission to promote the value of instrumental and classical music to the wider University community through organizing and facilitating accessible and polished artistic productions, Kinetic Sound attracted top student talents in music, design, photography, marketing, strategy, and finance, and organized some of the most successful student-led instrumental music concerts on campus. After gathering more than 140 students at its first concert in Fall 2015 - just 3 months after the organization was founded with 3 members - Kinetic Sound continued its dynamic growth to present an outdoor instrumental music concert with approx. 230 student audience members in Spring 2017. Once thought impossible, classical and instrumental music concerts with 100+ students in the audience is now a regular occurrence at UVA.

				A multidisciplinary performing arts project designed for a modern reinterpretation of the tradition and culture representing the University of Virginia. In addition to directing the product design/branding, financial planning, and public relations, I pitched the project before the UVA Bicentennial Committee, as well as at a selective <a class="contentLink" href = "https://newcityarts.org/vocation/charlottesville-soup" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">crowdfunding event</a> to secure and manage $4,000 in various institutional sponsorships. The resulting media, released on Facebook and YouTube, gathered over 2,000 views.

			<p class="description">
				As the Cultural Chair of the Japan Club at the University of Virginia, I reached out to the University's Japanese language faculty to connect with a visiting calligraphy master from Japan. Through written and in-person negotiations, I was able to curate a professional calligraphy performance for UVA students at no charge, while serving as a liaison between the faculty, students, and community members to organize cultural exchange sessions for the calligrapher's family.

			<p class="description">
				Just 2 years after learning the Japanese language, I participated in J.LIVE Talk, a national Japanese speech contest with contestants from across 19 states. After speaking about the importance of vision in one's fulfillment, I placed 2nd in the highest category, earning a one-week, all-expenses-paid cultural trip to Japan, sponsored and organized by the Japan Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
