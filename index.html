				With recent bachelor's degrees from Computer Science and Music from the University of Virginia (2018), I use Java, HTML/CSS, and Javascript to build and maintain enterprise web applications facing more than 40,000 users. Shaped by my entrepreneurship experience of working with more than 100 cross-functional volunteer student designers, musicians, and strategists, I believe that the interdependent presence of functionality and design is vital to the success of any product. On top of writing reusable and well-documented code, I place importance in designing beautiful user experience that help establish meaningful connection between the user and the product.

				This is where I learned what it means to lead without authority, build mission-driven teams, and balance short-term and long-term strategic goals. Committed to creating polished instrumental music productions for the millennials, I worked with top student talents in music, design, marketing, and strategy to continuously refine priorities and strategies based on user interviews.

				From the beginning to the end of my leadership term, Kinetic Sound faced the same difficulties as all other student organizations on campus: its members being volunteers with primary objectives as full-time University students. By being able to recognize and address this fundamental challenge, I was able to lead the group into a successful launch of its first live classical music concert production designed for college students, attracting <a class="contentLink" href="https://youtu.be/F0fl-afxh8M?t=31" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">over 140</a> students in Fall 2015, just three months after the founding of Kinetic Sound. From there, we continued to focus on user feedback - both internal and external - and hit the record number of student audience in 2017, making it the largest student audience for any instrumental music concert production at UVA in the recent years.

				The unexpected success with attracting college students to classical music concerts can be attributed to one key strategy that tied together the different components and talents within the organization. In using social media as the major distribution channel for visual arts products created in collaboration with the musicians, my vision was to not only bridge the conceptual gap between the audience and the less popular genre of classical music, but more importantly to deeply penetrate the social network of the student artists involved in the organization. This allowed Kinetic Sound to give a sense of ownership, community, and brand even to those not in the organization.

				While the number of active members was a strong indicator of performance and brand for many organizations on campus, there were some core values within members that I valued far more importantly than simply getting them to join: a demonstrated passion for creativity, a dedicated curiosity about the world and/or themselves, and personal integrity. I worked tirelessly to align the organization's objectives and interests with these members' values, and it was through these values that Kinetic Sound continued to attract top student talents at the University, cultivating its mission-focused culture that drove the growth of the organization.

				How would you go about communicating the following idea to recruit people and earn institutional sponsorships? A vague vision of a design concept, with the University's 200-year-old school song rebranded in cutting-edge modernity, performed by a group of students dressed in avant-garde fashion, and played on piano, electric bass, and 4 trash cans.<br>
				By partnering up with a designer, I successfully conveyed this concept to a number of audiences in writing, phone, and presentations in front of crowds as large as 150 people at a selective <a class="contentLink" href = "https://newcityarts.org/vocation/charlottesville-soup" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">crowdfunding event</a>. I was able to secure a total of $4,000 in sponsorships, and spearheaded the creation of a multidisciplinary film product that captured the complex layers of developments experienced by University students and community over time.

				After my first year at the University of Virginia, I understood that an authentic Japanese cultural experience was extremely rare, despite being highly sought after by students seeking cross-cultural knowledge. This is why, armed with just two semesters of education in the Japanese language, I reached out to the local Japanese community in quest of a collaboration. Establishing contact with a calligraphy master visiting from Japan, I led the following weeks of written and in-person negotiations involving the calligrapher, the locals, University faculty, and students, which helped me identify and organize a mutually beneficial solution for all those involved. As a result, more than 100 students, faculty, and local residents were able to enjoy a series of dynamic calligraphy performances, completely free of charge, as the calligrapher spontaneously produced calligraphy pieces using the lyrics of a <a href="https://youtu.be/LahJONm2ca4?t=79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">live song</a> that inspired her real-time.
