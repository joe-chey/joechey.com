			<p class="description">
				Committed to creating polished instrumental music productions marketed to a wider audience, Kinetic Sound attracted top student talents in music, design, marketing, strategy, and finance, and organized some of the most successful student-led instrumental music concerts at the University of Virginia. After gathering more than 140 students at its first concert in Fall 2015 - just 3 months after the organization was founded with 3 members - Kinetic Sound continuously refined its priorities and strategies based on user interviews, presenting an outdoor instrumental music concert attended by over 230 student audience members in Spring 2017. Once thought impossible, classical and instrumental music concerts with 100+ students in the audience is now a regular occurrence at UVA.

				A multidisciplinary performing arts project designed for a modern reinterpretation of the tradition and culture representing the University of Virginia. In addition to creating and managing the project roadmap from beginning to completion, I pitched the project before the UVA Bicentennial Committee, as well as at a selective <a class="contentLink" href = "https://newcityarts.org/vocation/charlottesville-soup" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">crowdfunding event</a> to secure and manage $4,000 in various institutional sponsorships.

			<p class="description">
				In Fall of 2015, I initiated contact with a visiting calligraphy master from Japan to inquire about the possibility of a public demonstration of her crafts for a Japanese culture event I was organizing. After weeks of written and in-person negotiation process, I was able to curate a unique professional calligraphy performance accessible to all University of Virginia students and community members at no charge, where the calligrapher dynamically produced calligraphy pieces with the lyrics of a live song that inspired her real-time.

			<p class="description">
				2 years into learning the Japanese language, I participated in J.LIVE Talk, a national Japanese speech contest with contestants from across 19 states. After speaking on the importance of vision in one's fulfillment, I placed 2nd in the highest category, earning a one-week, all-expenses-paid cultural exchange trip to Japan, sponsored and organized by the Japan Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
