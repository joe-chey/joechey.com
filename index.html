				With recent bachelor's degrees from Computer Science and Music from the University of Virginia (2018), I use Java, HTML/CSS, and Javascript to build and maintain enterprise web applications facing more than 40,000 users. Shaped by my entrepreneurship experience of working with more than 100 cross-functional volunteer student designers, musicians, and strategists, I believe that the interdependent presence of functionality and design is vital to the success of any product. On top of writing reusable and well-documented code, I place importance in designing beautiful user experience that help establish meaningful connection between the user and the product.

				Committed to creating polished instrumental music productions for the millennials, Kinetic Sound attracted top student talents in music, design, marketing, strategy, and finance, and organized some of the most successful student-led instrumental music concerts at the University of Virginia. As I recruited and managed more than 30 cross-functional student volunteers, I gained a deep understanding of what it means to lead without authority - to help people work efficiently and joyfully to accomplish stretch goals when they have numerous other competing tasks. After gathering more than 140 students at its first concert in 2015 - just 3 months after the organization was founded with 3 members - Kinetic Sound continuously refined its priorities and strategies based on user interviews, presenting an outdoor instrumental music concert attended by over 230 student audience members in 2017.

				With over 2,000 views on social media, this multidisciplinary performing arts project is a modern reinterpretation of the tradition and culture representing the University of Virginia. In addition to creating and managing the project roadmap from beginning to completion, I pitched the project on numerous occasions, including a selective <a class="contentLink" href = "https://newcityarts.org/vocation/charlottesville-soup" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">crowdfunding event</a> to secure and manage $4,000 in multiple institutional sponsorships.

				In 2015, I initiated contact with a visiting calligraphy master from Japan with an inquiry regarding a public demonstration of her crafts for a Japanese culture event I was organizing. After weeks of written and in-person negotiation with the calligrapher, community members, and the event staff, I successfully curated a unique professional calligraphy performance open to public at no charge, where the calligrapher dynamically produced calligraphy pieces with the lyrics of a live song that inspired her real-time.
