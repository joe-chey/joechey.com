				A vague vision of a design concept, with the University's 200-year-old school song rebranded in cutting-edge modernity, performed by a group of students dressed in avant-garde fashion, and played on piano, electric bass, and 4 trash cans. In presenting this concept to prospective members, partners, and sponsors, I was able to gain a deep experience in communicating a truly abstract idea to stakeholders for mutual understanding.<br>
				I worked tirelessly to convey this concept to a number of audiences in writing, phone, and presentations in front of crowds as large as 150 people at a selective <a class="contentLink" href = "https://newcityarts.org/vocation/charlottesville-soup" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">crowdfunding event</a>, and successfully secured $4,000 in institutional sponsorships. With the funding and close collaboration with a designer, I was able to spearhead the creation of a multidisciplinary film product that captured the complex layers of developments experienced by University students and community over time.
