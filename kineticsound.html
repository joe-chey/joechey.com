			<p class="description">
				Committed to creating polished instrumental music productions for the millennials, Kinetic Sound attracted top student talents in music, design, marketing, strategy, and finance, and organized some of the most successful student-led instrumental music concerts at the University of Virginia. As I recruited and managed more than 30 cross-functional student volunteers, I gained a deep understanding of what it means to lead without authority - to help people work efficiently and joyfully to accomplish stretch goals when they have numerous other competing tasks. After gathering more than 140 students at its first concert in 2015 - just 3 months after the organization was founded with 3 members - Kinetic Sound continuously refined its priorities and strategies based on user interviews, presenting an outdoor instrumental music concert attended by over 230 student audience members in 2017.
